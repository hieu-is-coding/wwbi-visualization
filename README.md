# üìä Data Visualization - Bureaucracy, Budgets, and the Gender Gap: A Global and Local Perspective

## Dataset: Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators

### üìù Dataset Description

The **Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators (WWBI)** is a rich, cross-national dataset developed by the **World Bank‚Äôs Bureaucracy Lab** to fill a longstanding gap in public sector employment and wage data. Unlike perception-based governance measures, the WWBI is grounded in **administrative records and household surveys**, making it one of the most robust and comprehensive datasets of its kind.

The WWBI enables systematic comparisons **within the public sector** and **between public and private sectors**, offering insights into workforce demographics, wage structures, and the fiscal implications of government employment. It supports research on the personnel dimensions of **state capability**, **gender equity**, and the **public sector‚Äôs footprint** in national labor markets.

### üí° Reason for Choosing the Dataset

We chose this dataset because it:
- Provides rich, policy-relevant information on **government workforce composition**.
- Offers a unique lens to explore **gender equity**, **economic priorities**, and **regional disparities**.
- Enables both **global comparison** and **country-specific analysis**, making it ideal for storytelling through visualization.
- Aligns with our interest in public policy, gender studies, and labor economics.

## Research Questions

### ‚ùì **Question 1**
**How has the proportion of GDP allocated to public wages changed over time across different world regions and income groups (2000‚Äì2020)?**

#### üîß Variables Involved
- `year`
- `indicator_code` = `BI.WAG.TOTL.GD.ZS` (Wage bill as a percentage of GDP)
- `value`
- `country_code`
- `income_group`
- `region`

#### üìä Plan for Analysis
- *Filtering relevant data*: Filter dataset for the selected indicator `BI.WAG.TOTL.GD.ZS`.
- *Handing missing data*: Since `df.isnull().sum()` results in sparse value (~ 3% of rows), our team drops rows with `dropna()` for simplicity. If there is potential biases, we would consider imputation (e.g, median imputation, forward or backward fill, interpolation for time gaps).
- *Aggregation*: Group by `region`, `income_group`, and `year`, then calculate the mean `value` for each group to smooth out country-level noise.
- *Preprocessing*: As `df.value.hist()` illustrates Right-Skewed histogram, it is necessary to apply a **log scale** to emphasize regions' differences.
- *Clustering*: Ultilize time-series clustering to show how countries‚Äô wage bills change over time, aligning trends across regions and income groups.
- *Visualiztion*: Use **line charts** with **facets by region** and **colors by income group**.
- *Insight*: Highlight trends, outliers, and policy implications.

###  **Question 2**
**How has the gap in female representation between high-level (managers, professionals, technicians) and low-level (clerks, elementary workers) occupations evolved over time (2010‚Äì2016) in Vietnam, and how does it differ between the public and private sectors?**

#### üîß Variables Involved
- `year`
- `country_code` = Vietnam
- `indicator_code`:  
  - Public sector:
    - `BI.PWK.PUBS.SN.FE.ZS` (Managers)
    - `BI.PWK.PUBS.PN.FE.ZS` (Professionals)
    - `BI.PWK.PUBS.TN.FE.ZS` (Technicians)
    - `BI.PWK.PUBS.CK.FE.ZS` (Clerks)
    - `BI.PWK.PUBS.EO.FE.ZS` (Elementary workers)  
  - Private sector:  
    - `BI.PWK.PRVS.SN.FE.ZS`, `...` (same structure)

- `value`

#### üìä Plan for Analysis
- *Filtering relevant data*: Filter for Vietnam (`country_code` = `VNM`) from 2010 to 2016 and select relevant gender representation indicators (`indicator_code` contains `FE.ZS`).
- *Handing missing data*:
- *Aggregation*: Group into two categories: **high-level** (managers, professionals, technicians) and **low-level** (clerks, elementary workers).
- *Preprocessing*: Calculate average female representation per group and compute the **gap** (high - low).
- *Clustering*: Since multiple sectors are being investigated, K-mean clustering can help to reveal comparable patterns.
- *Visualiztion*: Compare public vs. private sectors using **grouped line plots** or **slope charts**.
- *Insight*: Highlight trends in **career mobility** and potential **gender barriers**.

### üîÑ External Data
- No additional datasets are required at this stage. If necessary, we may incorporate:
  - Country-level policy events or economic indicators 
  - Regional aggregates or population statistics for normalization (e.g., labor force size)

#### üí° Responding to issues
- Short time frame choice (2010-2016) for second research question:
  - According to the **wwbi_country.csv** dataset, Vietnam's `national_accounts_base_year` indicates 2010. Here the base year is a fixed parameter used for official accounting purposes.
  - Since we narrow down our search to Vietnamese female, **wwbi_data.csv** only provides a range data from 2007 to 2016. However, this dataset also includes unofficial survey, we should count from the official base year from 2010. 
  - Therefore the (short) time period ranges from 2010 to 2016 based on the context of dataset. However, the data is still abundant to visualization.

- Does the first research question indicate inefficiency or better governance?
  - Indeed, apart from the GDP public wages proportion, GDP growth, inflation, and policy changes also contribute to the judgement of governance's effectiveness. However, with rich resources from **Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators**, it is still able to outline promising implications.
  - For example, higher public wage bill can suggest extensive welfare services, for country like Sweden, where public sector employment supports universal healthcare and education. Or lower public wage bill can mean underinvestment in public services, leading to poor governance, especially in low-income countries where basic services like education are underfunded.
