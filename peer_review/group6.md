# Peer review for proposal – Group 17
Thank you for sharing your project proposal! Below are a few suggestions that we hope will help enhance your work even further.

## Question 1:
Your first question—“How have the average age, height, and weight of Olympic athletes changed over the years across different sports or by gender?”—is clearly stated and very interesting to analyze. The variable choices are appropriate, and your plan for trend analysis makes sense. However, we think the scope could be more clearly defined. For instance:
- Are you analyzing all athletes, or only those who won medals?
- Will your analysis be global, or broken down by region, sport category, or Olympic season (Summer vs. Winter)?

Clarifying this will help make your findings more interpretable and allow for cleaner visual storytelling.

We found a very interesting article that quite relates to your content: (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/charted-olympic-athletes-getting-bigger/). They use scatter plot overlaid on a BMI classification chart, comparing the mean weight and height of Olympic athletes in 1960 and 2016, separated by gender. By this colorful visualization, they spot out an outlier which is Women gymnasts. You could take inspiration from this and even expand it across multiple years or sports!

## Question 2:
Your second question—“How has hosting the Olympics affected the host country’s GDP?”—is ambitious and intriguing. It opens the door to meaningful economic insights. That said, measuring GDP impact is complex due to confounding variables like global recessions, policy changes, or exchange rate fluctuations. To strengthen your approach, here are a few ideas:
- Consider using control groups: Compare the GDP change of host countries to non-host countries with similar baseline GDP, population, or regional context. This can help isolate the effect of Olympic hosting.
- Look at GDP growth rate, not just absolute values—percentage changes might be more meaningful across countries of different economic sizes.
- Use multiple-year windows: Look at GDP 4–5 years before and after the hosting year to capture both preparation and post-event economic activity.

Regarding visualization:
- A dual-axis line plot can be effective to show GDP alongside Olympic events.
- An interactive heatmap (e.g., using Plotly) with countries as rows and years as columns could be a powerful tool to visualize GDP trends over time and highlight Olympic years.
- You could also consider slope charts to emphasize before-and-after hosting changes.


Good luck and have fun with your project – we look forward to seeing your final work!
