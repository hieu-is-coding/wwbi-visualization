# Visualization suggestions

## Question 1:

A clear question with effient variable choices. But our team believe that there should be more detailed clarification: all athletes vs only medalists or global vs region-specific.

We found a very interesting article that quite relates to your content: (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/charted-olympic-athletes-getting-bigger/). They use scatter plot overlaid on a BMI classification chart, comparing the mean weight and height of Olympic athletes in 1960 and 2016, separated by gender. By this colorful visualization, they spot out an outlier which is Women gymnasts.

## Question 2:

When it comes to GDP there are usually a lot of variable to consider due to confounding factors (such as global economic trends, domestic policies). You may need to perform various visualization for comparative analysis.

If you stick to line plots, I recommend dual-axis line charts to show GDP growth alongside Olympic hosting years.

Ortherwise, a heatmap can well display GDP data with countries as rows, years as columns, and color intensity representing GDP values or growth rates. You could even enhance with Plotly to create an interactive heatmap.
